Display featured posts, custom menus, html content and more within a single dynamic sidebar that can be customized on a per-page or site-wide basis.

== Description ==

Why use IntelliWidget as your Featured Post plugin?

* Powerful and extensible, does the work of multiple plugins
* No new sidebars necessary–uses the sidebars you already have
* Displays custom page settings if they exist, main widget if they don’t
* Supports Custom Post Types and Custom Nav Menus
* Doubles as a Text Widget–customizable to any page
* Use as many different instances on a single page as you wish
* Saves hours setting up and maintaining your WordPress site
* Supports shortcodes so you can put the power of Intelliwidget anywhere in your site
* Set up one page and reuse settings on other pages
* No new database tables
* Clean uninstall
* Lets you keep using all your other widgets
* Shows or hides content by date and time
* Improves performance by retrieving Post data using a single query instead of multiple meta data function calls.

IntelliWidget eliminates the need for multiple sidebars to accommodate page-specific content. Instead, you use one set of dynamic sidebars, load a few IntelliWidgets and then customize on a per-page basis. If you don’t customize a page, the default widget (the one you configured on the widgets page) displays instead.

IntelliWidgets can include but are not limited to: custom page menus, featured posts, slider lists, arbitrary text/html (textwidgets), calendars, testimonials, categories and more.

IntelliWidget now supports Wordpress Custom Menus! Use the Nav Menu template option and select any Nav Menu to use on specific pages. Standard IntelliWidget Menus continue to work as before.

Expire posts on a specific date/time using the new date features. Also, you can combine active posts and expired posts to show only events going on currently.

Because the lists are generated using active titles and permalinks, your site is always current with the latest versions of your content.

Combine with custom post types to create unlimited CMS-style content blocks. Combine with your favorite jQuery Slider plugin to display animated slideshows. You can even use the settings from an existing page. Now you don't have to add a gazillion sidebars to your widgets admin to have unlimited page-specific content.

IntelliWidget is flexible and versatile. Please read the documentation to see more ideas how to use it to its full potential.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a quick tutorial? =

See the "Getting Started" section.

= Where can I find full documentation? =

Docs can be found at http://www.lilaeamedia.com/plugins/intelliwidget/

= Why isn't IntelliWidget displaying the featured image? =

By default, IntelliWidget does not display the featured image. To enable the featured image,
choose an image size under Advanced Settings > Image Size in the IntelliWidget settings.

= Why is are the posts showing and hiding several hours before or after the time I entered? =

Dates are calculated using the WordPress current_time() function. Make sure you have set the correct
timezone under Settings > General in the WordPress admin.

= Why isn't my Custom Post Type appearing as an option? =

Custom Post Types must support custom fields (post meta data) for IntelliWidget to recognize them. 
Change the 'supports' parameter in the register_post_type function to include 'custom-fields', e.g.,
    'supports' => array( 
      'title', 
      'editor', 
      'excerpt', 
      'thumbnail', 
      'author', 
      'custom-fields', 
      'revisions', 
    ),

== Getting Started ==

Here is a very simple example of how to use an IntelliWidget titled "My First IntelliWidget."

1. From Appearance > Widgets admin, drag the IntelliWidget over to one of your existing sidebars. 

2. Enter "My First IntelliWidget" in the Title input. Leave the "Link to Archive" box unchecked for now. Save the Widget.

3. Load a page from your site in a browser that uses the sidebar you just modified. You will see a menu of up to five links with the Title, "My First IntelliWidget." This is the default behavior: a menu of page links sorted by title. This is not very useful but it serves to understand the power of IntelliWidgets.

4. In the WordPress Admin, go to Pages and click to edit the page you just viewed. You will now see a new meta box labeled "IntelliWidget." Leave the "Use settings from" alone and click "Add new section."

5. When the page refreshes, you will see a new meta box with settings almost exactly like the ones in the Widgets Admin. Click the "Replaces" dropdown menu and you will see an option for the sidebar where you added the IntelliWidget. Select this option.

6. Give the section a title in the "Section Title" input. Type some text in the "Custom Text/HTML" textarea and select "Text Only-No Posts" option in the dropdown menu. Click "Save."

7. Now load the page you just edited in your browser. Instead of the menu from before, you now see the new title and the custom text you typed. If you go to any other page that uses the same sidebar, you will see the menu from before.

8. The point of this exercise is to demonstrate that any page can override the default widget with it's own custom section.

9. Lastly, you can select this page in the "Use Settings From..." menu from any other page to re-use these settings. This is useful if you have a sub-set of pages that need to re-use the same sidebar content. This feature alone can save hours of repetition wasted on many other "custom sidebar" plugins.
