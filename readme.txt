Combine custom page menus, featured posts, sliders and other content into any widget area that can be customized on a per-page or site-wide basis.

== Description ==

IntelliWidget is a versatile WordPress plugin that does the work of multiple plugins by allowing you to create custom "Profiles" for any page or post that can be used where the default widget would normally appear. Each profile can have its own set of rules to display content any way you wish.

Use the Shortcode option to put the power of IntelliWidget into any post on your site.

Because it is generated using active titles and permalinks, your sidebar content is always current with the latest versions.

Select posts by date, category, tag, and many other ways. Combine with custom post types to create unlimited CMS-style content blocks. Combine with your favorite jQuery Slider plugin to display animated slideshows.

Reuse the settings from existing profiles to save hours of setup time.

With IntelliWidget you can add just a few sidebar areas and create unlimited page-specific content.

= What's New in Version 2: =

We've completely revised the Admin Interface to make setup easier and more intuitive.

= Tabbed Profile Panels =

All of the IntelliWidget Profile settings panels have been combined into a single tab menu on the Edit Post admin pages. You can hover over the tab to see the IntelliWidget the Profile replaces.

= Less Confusing Save Button =

We changed the save buttons to a more subdued gray to prevent confusing it with the Edit Post primary save button.

= Improved Settings Panels =

Settings have been organized into collapsible sections so the settings you use most can be found in one place.

Hover over any input label and more details describing the input will appear.

General Settings include a new "IntelliWidget Type," which controls whether a normal post list or a WordPress Nav Menu is displayed. Section title, unique id and classes fields are grouped together for easy access. The new Archive Taxonomy premium extension will also add a new IntelliWidget type, "Taxonomy Menu," that enables navigation through any public hierarchical taxonomy.

We have moved the "Template," "Post Types," "Specific Posts," and "Terms" menus to a "Post Selection" new panel to keep the most-used settings together in one place. Here you will also find the Post Custom Data Field Date condition checkboxes.

= Select Posts Using Any Taxonomy =

We've replaced the "Category" menu with a new "Terms" menu. IntelliWidget automatically updates your data to reflect this change. You can now select posts based on Tags and Custom Taxonomies as well as Categories. You can also use multiple terms in the same profile.

You can control the way posts are sorted, post sort order, number posts shown, excerpt length, HTML filters, image size and image alignment.

You can add a block of text or HTML and control where it appears relative to the featured post content. You can even use any shortcodes your theme supports.

= Revised code for stability and performance =

Now all the admin functions are loaded on demand so WordPress doesn't work as hard for front-end users. Long menus are now loaded dynamically to reduce admin page size.

= Actions and Filters =

We've made IntelliWidget completely extensible by utilizing action and filter hooks at key points of the execution.

= Now Available: IntelliWidget Archive and Taxonomy Extension =

Now you can have custom IntelliWidgets on any Archive page! Choose the criteria and customize the Profiles for Blog pages, Categories, Tags and more.
New Taxonomy Menu lets you browse hierarchical taxonomies, showing sibling and child terms based on the current page. See http://www.lilaeamedia.com/plugins/archive-taxonomy-extension for more information.

= Coming Soon: IntelliWidget Template Configurator Extension =

* Create your own custom templates right from the IntelliWidget admin.

= More Reasons to use IntelliWidget for Featured Posts and Custom Menus =

* Powerful and extensible, does the work of multiple plugins
* No new sidebars necessary–uses the sidebars you already have
* Displays custom page settings if they exist, main widget if they don't
* Supports Custom Post Types and Custom Nav Menus
* Doubles as a Text Widget–customizable to any page
* Use as many different instances on a single page as you wish
* Saves hours setting up and maintaining your WordPress site
* Set up one page and reuse settings on other pages
* No new database tables
* Clean uninstall
* Lets you keep using all your other widgets
* Shows or hides content by date and time
* Improves performance by retrieving Post data using a single query instead of multiple meta data function calls.
IntelliWidget is flexible and versatile. Please read the documentation to see more ideas how to use it to its full potential.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a quick tutorial? =

See the "Getting Started" section or watch the Quick Start Tutorial:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttw1xIZ2b-g

= Where can I find full documentation? =

Docs can be found at http://www.lilaeamedia.com/plugins/intelliwidget/

= How do I put a custom menu on one specific page? =

*Method 1:*

 * Add a new IntelliWidget to one of your sidebars on the Widgets Admin. Check the "Placeholder only" box. This keeps the widget from appearing on all the pages.
 * Go to Pages and click the page to edit.
 * You will see a new meta box labeled "IntelliWidget Profiles."
 * Click "+ Add New Profile."
 * Select the sidebar to which you added the IntelliWidget in the first step from the "Parent Profile to replace" menu.
 * From the "Post Selection" panel, choose the "Menu" template.
 * Select the posts for your menu from the "specific posts" multi-select menu.
 * Click "Save Settings."
 
*Method 2:*

 * If you have a custom menu already set up in the "Appearance > Menus" you can use it instead of building it from scratch.
 * Follow the steps as before.
 * In the Child Profile, open the "General Settings" panel. Select "Nav Menu" from the "IntelliWidget Type" menu.
 * Select the menu you want to use from the "Menu to use" select menu.
 * Click "Save Settings."
 
*Method 3:*

 * Use the IntelliWidget Shortcode on the page. You don't need a Placeholder to use this option.
 * Set up a new Child Profile on the page like usual, but select "Shortcode in Post Content" as the "Profile to replace" option.
 * In the content, add the shortcode [intelliwidget section=#] where # is the number of the Child Profile tab.

= Where do I put custom templates/stylesheets? =

Here are the steps:

1. Add a directory in your theme named "intelliwidget".
2. Create a copy of "intelliwidget.css" (located in the "templates" directory of the plugin) and drop it into this directory.
3. Adjust the styles as necessary.
4. Review the documentation for more information:
    * Templates: http://www.lilaeamedia.com/templates
    * Stylesheet: http://www.lilaeamedia.com/intelliwidget-stylesheet

= Why isn't IntelliWidget displaying the featured image? =

By default, IntelliWidget does not display the featured image. To enable the featured image,
open the "Appearance" panel in the IntelliWidget settings and choose an image size from the "Image Size" select menu.

= Why are posts showing and hiding several hours before or after the time I entered? =

Dates are calculated using the WordPress current_time() function. Make sure you have set the correct
timezone under Settings > General in the WordPress admin.

= Why isn't my Custom Post Type appearing as an option? =

Custom Post Types must support custom fields (post meta data) for IntelliWidget to recognize them. 
Change the 'supports' parameter in the register_post_type function to include 'custom-fields', e.g.,

    'supports' => array( 
      'title', 
      'editor', 
      'excerpt', 
      'thumbnail', 
      'author', 
      'custom-fields', 
      'revisions', 
    ),

2. Example of the Edit Post Admin Panel.
3. Example of the Profiles Panel.

== Getting Started ==

Here is a very simple example that illustrates the basics: a Parent Profile replaced by a Child Profile.

1. Start by dragging the widget labeled "IntelliWidget" over to one of your existing sidebars. The new IntelliWidget panel will open revealing the various settings groups. This is now the "Parent Profile" for this IntelliWidget instance.

2. Open the "Post Selection" panel by clicking the bar. You will see a multi-select menu containing all of your pages and posts.

3. Hold down the option key ("Command" on Mac) and select a few of your pages and click the "Save" button at the bottom of the widget panel.

4. Load a page from your site in a browser that uses the sidebar you just modified. You will see a menu of the pages you added in the previous step. This is the default behavior: a menu of page links sorted by title.

5. In the WordPress Admin, go to "Pages" and select the page you just viewed. You will now see a new meta box labeled "IntelliWidget Profiles."

6. Click "+ Add New Profile." A tabbed panel will appear containing settings almost exactly like the ones in the Widgets Admin.

7. Click the "Parent Profile to Replace" dropdown menu and you will see an option for the sidebar where you added the IntelliWidget Parent Profile. Select this option.

8. Open the "Additional Text/HTML" Panel by clicking the bar.

9. Select "This text only (no posts)" option in the "Display" dropdown menu.

10. Type some text in the "Custom Text/HTML" textarea. Click "Save Settings."

11. Now load the page you just edited in your browser. Instead of the menu from before, you now see the new title and the custom text you typed. If you go to any other page that uses the same sidebar, you will see the menu from before.

12. Finally, you can select this page in the "Use Profiles From" menu from any other page to re-use these settings. This is useful if you have a sub-set of pages that need to re-use the same sidebar content.
    
IMPORTANT: As of 1.4.5 the definition of "Future" posts (formerly "events") has been modified to simplify use and to make the interface more intuitive. This may require adjustments to date-dependent IntelliWidgets and Post date fields.

Checking "Only Future Posts" excludes posts with a Start Date < current date/time, regardless of Expire Date. (Formerly "Only Future Events.")
Checking "Exclude Future Posts" hides posts with a Start Date > current date/time, regardless of Expire Date. (Formerly "Only Active Events.")  
The "Exclude Expired Posts" behavior has not changed.
